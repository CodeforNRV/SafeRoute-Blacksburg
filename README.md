# SafeRoute-Blacksburg
An app designed to show safer walking routes around Blacksburg, VA

Developed using PhoneGap, this is a split off of the initial project repository SafeWalk Blacksburg: https://github.com/CodeforNRV/safe_walk_blacksburg. Due to another app used in the No Hokie Left Behind suite using the moniker SafeWalk, we decided to change the name. This respository will also represent the PhoneGap application portion of the project, while another repository will hold the server-side processing portion or the project.

SafeRoute-Blacksburg is designed to help residents and visitors of Blacksburg, VA, walk around as safely as possible, with a particular emphasis on nighttime safety. To this end, it presents a map of roads that are color coded based on the presence of sidewalks and streetlights along road segments and the speed limit of the road segments. There are plans to provide overlay maps, such as recent crime activity, to alert the user if they wish to avoid those areas.

It currently does not provide routing, but simply shows current location and selected destination (if any) and allows the user to choose their own route based on the color-coded map.
